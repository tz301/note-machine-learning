## Machine Learning的定义
1. Arthur Samuel(1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability
to learn without being explicitly programmed.
2. Tom Mitchel(1998): A computer program is said to *learn* from
experience E with expect to some task T and some performance measure P,
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. <br/>
例如: 在下棋任务中, E - 多次下棋的经验, T - 下棋任务, P - 下棋获胜的概率.

## Machine Learning算法
1. 监督学习(Supervised Learning): 包括回归和分类, 回归预测连续值, 分类预测离散值.
2. 非监督学习(Unsupervised Learning).
3. 其他: 强化学习(Reinforcement Learning).

## Quiz
1. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect
to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T,
as measured by P, improves with experience E. Suppose we feed a
learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn
to predict weather. What would be a reasonable choice for P? <br/>
(A) <br/>
A. The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's
weather. <br/>
B. None of these. <br/>
C. The weather prediction task. <br/>
D. The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical
weather data. <br/>

2. Suppose you are working on weather prediction, and use a learning
algorithm to predict tomorrow's temperature (in degrees
Centigrade/Fahrenheit). <br/>
Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem? <br/>
(A) <br/>
A. Regression <br/>
B. Classification <br/>

3. Suppose you are working on stock market prediction, Typically tens
of millions of shares of Microsoft stock are traded (i.e., bought/sold)
each day. You would like to predict the number of Microsoft shares that
will be traded tomorrow. Would you treat this as a classification or a
regression problem? <br/>
(A) <br/>
A. Regression <br/>
B. Classification <br/>

4. Some of the problems below are best addressed using a supervised
learning algorithm, and the others with an unsupervised learning
algorithm. Which of the following would you apply supervised learning
to? (Select all that apply.) In each case, assume some appropriate
dataset is available for your algorithm to learn from. <br/>
(CD) <br/>
A. Examine a large collection of emails that are known to be spam
email, to discover if there are sub-types of spam mail. <br/>
B. Take a collection of 1000 essays written on the US Economy, and find
a way to automatically group these essays into a small number of groups
of essays that are somehow "similar" or "related". <br/>
C. Given 50 articles written by male authors, and 50 articles written
by female authors, learn to predict the gender of a new manuscript's
author (when the identity of this author is unknown). <br/>
D. Given historical data of children's ages and heights, predict
children's height as a function of their age. <br/>

5. Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning? <br/>
(A) <br/>
A. Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. <br/>
B. Machine learning learns from labeled data. <br/>
C. Machine learning is the field of allowing robots to act intelligently. <br/>
D. Machine learning is the science of programming computers. <br/>
