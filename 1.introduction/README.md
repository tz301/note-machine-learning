## Machine Learning的定义
1. Arthur Samuel(1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability
to learn without being explicitly programmed.
2. Tom Mitchel(1998): A computer program is said to *learn* from
experience E with expect to some task T and some performance measure P,
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.<br/>
例如: 在下棋任务中, E - 多次下棋的经验, T - 下棋任务, P - 下棋获胜的概率.

## Machine Learning算法
1. 监督学习(Supervised Learning): 包括回归和分类, 回归预测连续值, 分类预测离散值.
2. 非监督学习(Unsupervised Learning).
3. 其他: 强化学习(Reinforcement Learning).
